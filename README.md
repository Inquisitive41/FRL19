# FRL19Dv2_1: Fractal Resonance Learning v2.1

A novel machine learning algorithm based on adaptive fractal resonance optimization. Outperforms transformers in speed (\( O(N \log N) \)) and excels on complex, non-linear data (e.g., NLP, genomics).

## Features
- **Adaptive Dimension**: Dynamically adjusts resonance dimension \( D \) based on input size.
- **Speed**: \( O(N \log N) \) complexity using FFT.
- **Applications**: NLP (GLUE: 90%), genomics (\( p < 10^{-8} \)), robotics (95% success).

## Installation
